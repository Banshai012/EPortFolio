Hello, my name is Benjamin Krief. I'm currently a Computer Science and Telecommunication student at N7, a top-ranking engineering graduate school based in Toulouse in France. I was able to go to this school after studying at the Classe Preparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles (CPGE) Jean Perrin at Marseilles during two years, which provided me with an extensive foundation in mathematics and critical thinking. I fell in love for informatics during my classe préparatoire, where I discovered the Python language, and alone, I started to learn html and css languages.

I am eager to pursue an internship in cybersecurity, inspired by experts like Kevin Mitnick, whose trailblazing work in ethical hacking and cybersecurity strategy has fueled my commitment to defending digital ecosystems from ever-evolving threats. Additionally, I am motivated to drive forward developments in artificial intelligence, drawing inspiration from visionaries like Yann LeCun, whose breakthroughs in deep learning resonate with my ambition to design AI solutions that push technological boundaries and transform everyday life. Lastly, as a dedicated fan of fighting games, especially Rivals of Aether 2, I aspire to work in game development at studios like Aether Studios. There, I hope to combine my technical skills and creative vision to enhance and innovate within the immersive world of combat gaming.
