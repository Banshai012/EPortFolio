Hello, my name is Benjamin Krief. I'm currently a Computer Science and Telecommunications student at N7, a top-ranking engineering graduate school based in Toulouse, France. I was able to attend this school after studying for two years at the Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE) Jean Perrin in Marseille, which provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics and critical thinking. I fell in love with computer science during my classe préparatoire, where I discovered the Python language and began teaching myself HTML and CSS.

In my future studies, I am excited to explore three dynamic fields: cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and video games.

First, in cybersecurity, I aspire to follow in the footsteps of industry leaders like Kevin Mitnick, a renowned hacker turned security consultant. His work emphasizes the importance of protecting data and systems from cyber threats, and I aim to contribute to this critical field by developing robust security solutions.

Next, I am fascinated by artificial intelligence. I look up to Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, whose groundbreaking work in AI has pushed the boundaries of what machines can achieve. I want to explore how AI can transform industries and improve our daily lives.

Lastly, the world of video games captivates me. I have a deep appreciation for Super Smash Bros. Melee, a classic fighting game that has shaped competitive gaming, and I’m excited about the recent release of Rivals of Aether 2, which showcases innovative mechanics and vibrant gameplay. I want to create immersive gaming experiences that can entertain and bring people together, just like these games have done.

These three fields not only align with my passions but also offer opportunities to make a significant impact in our ever-evolving digital landscape.
