Hello, my name is Benjamin Krief. I'm currently a Computer Science and Telecommunications student at N7, a top-ranking engineering graduate school based in Toulouse, France. I was able to attend this school after studying for two years at the Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE) Jean Perrin in Marseille, which provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics and critical thinking. I fell in love with computer science during my classe préparatoire, where I discovered the Python language and began teaching myself HTML and CSS.

I am eager to pursue an internship in cybersecurity, inspired by experts like Kevin Mitnick, whose trailblazing work in ethical hacking and cybersecurity strategy has fueled my commitment to defending digital ecosystems from ever-evolving threats. Additionally, I am motivated to drive forward developments in artificial intelligence, drawing inspiration from visionaries like Yann LeCun, whose breakthroughs in deep learning resonate with my ambition to design AI solutions that push technological boundaries and transform everyday life. Lastly, as a dedicated fan of fighting games, especially Super Smash Bros Melee or the recent Rivals of Aether 2, I aspire to work in game development at studios like Aether Studios. There, I hope to combine my technical skills and creative vision to enhance and innovate within the immersive world of combat gaming.
