Hello, my name is Benjamin Krief. I'm currently a Computer Science and Telecommunications student at N7, a top-ranking engineering graduate school based in Toulouse, France. I was able to attend this school after studying for two years at the Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE) Jean Perrin in Marseille, which provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics and critical thinking. I fell in love with computer science during my classe préparatoire, where I discovered the Python language and began teaching myself HTML and CSS.

In my future studies, I am excited to explore three dynamic fields: cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and video games. 

First, in cybersecurity, I aspire to follow in the footsteps of industry leaders like Kevin Mitnick, a renowned hacker turned security consultant. His work emphasizes the importance of protecting data and systems from cyber threats, and I aim to contribute to this critical field by developing robust security solutions. I envision myself working in San Francisco, a hub for tech innovation and home to some of the world’s top cybersecurity firms. There, I would have the opportunity to collaborate with industry experts and stay at the forefront of cybersecurity advancements.

Next, I am fascinated by artificial intelligence. I look up to Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, whose groundbreaking work in AI has pushed the boundaries of what machines can achieve. I want to explore how AI can transform industries and improve our daily lives by addressing complex problems across various domains, from healthcare to finance. London, DeepMind’s headquarters, would be an ideal location for me to immerse myself in AI research. In a city renowned for its research institutions and AI labs, I could contribute to cutting-edge projects with global impact.

Lastly, the world of video games captivates me. I have a deep appreciation for Super Smash Bros. Melee, a classic fighting game that has shaped competitive gaming, and I’m excited about the recent release of Rivals of Aether 2, which showcases innovative mechanics and vibrant gameplay. Inspired by these games, I want to create immersive gaming experiences that can entertain and bring people together. Tokyo would be a dream location for pursuing a career in game design, with its rich gaming culture and headquarters of legendary companies. Surrounded by creative talent and innovation, I would have the chance to contribute to a field that blends art and technology to create impactful, memorable experiences.

These three fields not only align with my passions but also offer opportunities to make a significant impact in our ever-evolving digital landscape. Each city represents a unique environment where I could learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what’s possible in cybersecurity, AI, and gaming.
